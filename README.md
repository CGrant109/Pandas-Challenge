# Title

# Pandas-Challenge:
# A Deep-Dive on School Performance

# Description:
# Through the use of Pandas, this project utilizes the powerful accesibility for the user to gain an overview of the overall performance of a High School distric compared to others, along with financial observations.

# Methods Used:
# Methods such as counting sums of unique values, finding overall means, using conditional statements, as well as .lo, .tail(), and .cut commands

# Technologies:
# Pandas, jupyter notebook

# Data Source:
# Data found in "Resources/schools_complete.csv"

# Bash:
# source activate PythonData38
# juputer notebook


# Additional Analysis:
# Conclusion 1:
# Across all schools, students seem to have a higher average reading score than math score, and have a higher pass percent in reading class than math.

# Conclusion 2:
# Larger schools have a trend of having substantially lower Math class passing percent (around 69% per "Scores by School Size"), compared to smaller schools (around 93% per "Scores by School Size"). This smaller school size in relation to a higher passing percent makes sense because smaller schools generally have smaller class sizes, which allows a teacher to focus on individual students more. Whereas in a larger school, with larger class sizes and only one teacher, it can be assumed that underperfomrance of a body of students can go unnoticed much easier than a smaller class size.
